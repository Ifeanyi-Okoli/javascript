My JavaScript Projects
ccValidation2 is a Bullseye Class project to develop a Credit Card Validation page.
The user of the App enters his/her credit card number as well as other details.
WHen the submit button is clicked, ccCheck() function in the JavaScript file is called and the ccCheck() calls the ccValidation() function which uses the luhn algorithm to run the text.
If valid, the background of the submit button turn green as well as the border of the input box for the credit card number, else they turn red.
